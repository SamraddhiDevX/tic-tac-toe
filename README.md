## TIC TAC TOE
I've created a cool Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's got two modes – one where you can play with friends and another where you challenge my super-smart computer opponent. Think you can beat it in single-player mode? Let the games begin! 😄

## 🎮 Single Player 

In this mode, you will play against a computer bot. 

- Click on the 'Single Player' button to play.
- First move will be yours(X) and afterwords bot will move(O), Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a message will appears once the game is over and you'll also see two buttons:
  - **Play Again'** button to play again.
  - **Home** button to return to the main menu.
- You will hear a sound effect on every move and also when the game will end.

## 🎮 Multiplayer 

In this mode, you can play with another person sitting next to you.

- First move will be X and afterwords O will move, Whether it's a win, loss, or a draw, a message will appears once the game is over and you'll also see two buttons:
  - **Play Again'** button to play again.
  - **Home** button to return to the main menu.
- You will hear a sound effect on every move and also when the game will end.
